         A promise is a special JavaScript object that links the “producing code” and the “consuming code” together. In terms of our 
analogy: this is the “subscription list”. The “producing code” takes whatever time it needs to produce the promised result, and the 
“promise” makes that result available to all of the subscribed code when it’s ready. Where a “producing code” that does something and
takes time. 
        For instance, the code loads a remote script. A “consuming code” that wants the result of the “producing code” once it’s ready. 
Many functions may need that result.

The constructor syntax for a promise object is:

    let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
          // executor (the producing code, "singer")
    });

Advantages of Promises:

•	Better definition of control flow of asynchronous logic.
•	Better error handling.
•	Improved readability.
