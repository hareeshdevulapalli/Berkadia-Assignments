Debugging/reading a functions becomes complex due to the Implementation of callback functions within a callback functions is known as 
callback Hell. Sometimes this makes us to face stack overflow condition in eventloop.
Example:
getPerson(person => {
   getPlanet(person, (planet) => {
       getGalaxy(planet, (galaxy) => {
           console.log(galaxy);
       });
   });
});
