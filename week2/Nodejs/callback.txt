A callback is a function that is to be executed after another function has finished executing. functions can take functions as 
arguments, and can be returned by other functions. Any function that is passed as an argument is called a callback function. 
Callbacks are a way to make sure certain code doesnâ€™t execute until other code has already finished execution
Example:

  function doHomework(subject, cb) {
  		console.log(`Starting my ${subject} homework.`);
  		cb();
  }
function cb(){
  		console.log('Finished my homework');
}
doHomework('math', cb);

Output:

Starting my math homework.
Finished my homework
